# OTP Verification Integration - Changes Summary

## Problem
The application was instantly transitioning to the OTP verification page before users had time to scan the QR code.

## Solution
Integrated the OTP verification component directly below the QR code on the same page, allowing users to:
1. View the QR code
2. Scan it with their authenticator app
3. Enter the generated OTP code without page transition
4. Then proceed to the next step after successful verification

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated QrPage Component (`src/app/Components/qrCode.tsx`)
- Added `showOTPVerification` state to control when the OTP component appears
- Modified the QR generation response handler to set `showOTPVerification = true` instead of immediately calling the callback
- Added the OTP verification component inline below the instructions section
- The component now shows up after the QR code is successfully generated
- Removed automatic page transition

### 2. Updated Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Added comment explaining that the view will only change to 'otp' after user has verified with the inline component
- Kept the callback handling for when user successfully verifies the OTP

## User Flow
```
Login Page
    ↓
QR Generation Page
    ├─ QR Code displayed
    ├─ Instructions shown
    └─ OTP Verification Component shown
        ├─ User enters code from authenticator
        ├─ On success → Full OTP verification page (optional)
        └─ On failure → Can retry scanning QR
```

## Benefits
✅ Users have unlimited time to scan the QR code
✅ Verification happens on the same page
✅ No sudden page transitions
✅ Better user experience
✅ Users can regenerate QR if needed

## Testing
1. Start the app and go through the login flow
2. After entering credentials and clicking AUTHENTICATE
3. Wait for QR code to be generated
4. You should see the QR code + OTP verification component on the same page
5. Scan with your authenticator app
6. Enter the generated code in the verification form
7. Upon successful verification, you'll either proceed to final confirmation or receive success message

## Notes
- The OTP verification component is now part of the QR page
- The main page still manages the overall navigation flow
- Users can go back at any time using the back button
- The shared secret is properly passed between components
